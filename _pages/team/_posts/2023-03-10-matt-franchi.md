Meet Matt Franchi: first-year Computer Science PhD student at Cornell Tech, urban tech enthusiast, and dashcam data wrangler. When he's not busy being a software wizard working on computational social science and applied computer vision projects, he's scaling mountains (or at least boulders) and channeling his creative energy into playing and composing original piano pieces.

Matt's most recent project involved collaborating with Professors Wendy Ju and Emma Pierson to derive police deployments of the NYPD using dashcam data. Don't worry though, he's not sacrificing individual privacy in his quest for urban sensing.

Before coming to Cornell Tech, Matt earned a B.S. in Computer Science from Clemson University Honors College, where he worked on autonomous vehicle simulation research with Dr. Amy Apon. He still manages to find time to read a book a week, and occasionally writes short articles on his blog.
